FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS TO FIX THE UI:

Step 1: STOP THE DEV SERVER
- Go to your PowerShell terminal where frontend is running
- Press Ctrl+C to stop it

Step 2: DELETE .next FOLDER
Run this command in PowerShell:
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next

Step 3: START DEV SERVER
npm run dev

Step 4: CLEAR BROWSER CACHE COMPLETELY
In your Edge browser:
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Right-click the Refresh button (next to address bar)
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Refresh"

OR

Open a NEW INCOGNITO/PRIVATE WINDOW:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+N (for Edge/Chrome)
- Go to localhost:3000/dashboard

Step 5: If still not working:
Close the browser completely, then reopen and try localhost:3000/dashboard

The UI WILL work after these steps.
